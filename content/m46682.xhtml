    >You may never have thought of it this way, but when you send a text message to two friends to meet you at the dining hall at six, you&#x2019;re sending digital signals that (you hope) will affect their behavior&#x2014;even though they are some distance away. Similarly, certain cells send chemical signals to other cells in the body that influence their behavior. This long-distance intercellular communication, coordination, and control is critical for homeostasis, and it is the fundamental function of the endocrine system.</p
