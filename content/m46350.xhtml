Since the first rib is hidden behind the clavicle, the second rib is the highest rib that can be identified by palpation. Thus, the sternal angle and second rib are important landmarks for the identification and counting of the lower ribs. Ribs 3&#x2013;7 attach to the sternal body.</p

Anteriorly, each rib ends in a costal cartilage. True ribs (1&#x2013;7) attach directly to the sternum via their costal cartilage. The false ribs (8&#x2013;12) either attach to the sternum indirectly or not at all. Ribs 8&#x2013;10 have their costal cartilages attached to the cartilage of the next higher rib. The floating ribs (11&#x2013;12) are short and do not attach to the sternum or to another rib.</p

          >A typical rib is a flattened, curved bone. The head of a rib is attached posteriorly to the costal facets of the thoracic vertebrae. The rib tubercle articulates with the transverse process of a thoracic vertebra. The angle is the area of greatest rib curvature and forms the largest portion of the thoracic cage. The body (shaft) of a rib extends anteriorly and terminates at the attachment to its costal cartilage. The shallow costal groove runs along the inferior margin of a rib and carries blood vessels and a nerve.</p

          >Ribs are classified based on if and how their costal cartilages attach to the sternum. True (vertebrosternal) ribs are ribs 1&#x2013;7. The costal cartilage for each of these attaches directly to the sternum. False (vertebrochondral) ribs, 8&#x2013;12, are attached either indirectly or not at all to the sternum. Ribs 8&#x2013;10 are attached indirectly to the sternum. For these ribs, the costal cartilage of each attaches to the cartilage of the next higher rib. The last false ribs (11&#x2013;12) are also called floating (vertebral) ribs, because these ribs do not attach to the sternum at all. Instead, the ribs and their small costal cartilages terminate within the muscles of the lateral abdominal wall.</p
