These compartments keep body cells separated from external environmental threats and keep the cells moist and nourished. They also separate internal body fluids from the countless microorganisms that grow on body surfaces, including the lining of certain tracts, or passageways. The intestinal tract, for example, is home to even more bacteria cells than the total of all human cells in the body, yet these bacteria are outside the body and cannot be allowed to circulate freely inside the body.</p

Blood vessels keep blood inside a closed circulatory system, and nerves and muscles are wrapped in connective tissue sheaths that separate them from surrounding structures. In the chest and abdomen, a variety of internal membranes keep major organs such as the lungs, heart, and kidneys separate from others.</p

As you read these words, red and white blood cells are moving throughout your body, muscle cells are contracting and relaxing to maintain your posture and to focus your vision, and glands are secreting chemicals to regulate body functions. Your body is coordinating the action of entire muscle groups to enable you to move air into and out of your lungs, to push blood throughout your body, and to propel the food you have eaten through your digestive tract. Consciously, of course, you contract your skeletal muscles to move the bones of your skeleton to get from one place to another (as the runners are doing in <a

      > is the process whereby unspecialized cells become specialized in both structure and function. After conception, when a female&#x2019;s egg cell is fertilized by a male&#x2019;s sperm cell, the fertilized egg begins to multiply, initially into a cluster of identical unspecialized cells. As cell division continues, however, the cells begin to undergo differentiation into distinct tissue layers, and eventually into all of the specialized cells, tissues, and organs of the fetus. The progression from the undifferentiated cells to certain types of differentiated cells goes on throughout life, even in the bodies of adults.</p

Some other specialized cells, however, have only a limited capacity for renewal. This is true, for example, of nerve cells of the nervous system. When death of such cells is extensive (as can occur in a stroke, which causes cell death in the brain), the system can fail. Because the body is an integrated whole, failure of a body system can ultimately lead to the death of the organism.</p
