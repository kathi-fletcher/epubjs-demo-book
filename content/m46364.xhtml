The sesamoid bone articulates with the underlying bones to prevent damage to the muscle tendon due to rubbing against the bones during movements of the joint. The patella is found in the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle, the large muscle of the anterior thigh that passes across the anterior knee to attach to the tibia. The patella articulates with the patellar surface of the femur and thus prevents rubbing of the muscle tendon against the distal femur. The patella also lifts the tendon away from the knee joint, which increases the leverage power of the quadriceps femoris muscle as it acts across the knee. The patella does not articulate with the tibia.</p

          >Runner&#x2019;s Knee</span
        > Runner&#x2019;s knee, also known as patellofemoral syndrome, is the most common overuse injury among runners. It is most frequent in adolescents and young adults, and is more common in females. It often results from excessive running, particularly downhill, but may also occur in athletes who do a lot of knee bending, such as jumpers, skiers, cyclists, weight lifters, and soccer players. It is felt as a dull, aching pain around the front of the knee and deep to the patella. The pain may be felt when walking or running, going up or down stairs, kneeling or squatting, or after sitting with the knee bent for an extended period.</p
      > <p
          class="para"
          id="fs-id1645525"
        >Patellofemoral syndrome may be initiated by a variety of causes, including individual variations in the shape and movement of the patella, a direct blow to the patella, or flat feet or improper shoes that cause excessive turning in or out of the feet or leg. These factors may cause in an imbalance in the muscle pull that acts on the patella, resulting in an abnormal tracking of the patella that allows it to deviate too far toward the lateral side of the patellar surface on the distal femur.</p
      > <p
          class="para"
          id="fs-id2339721"
        >Because the hips are wider than the knee region, the femur has a diagonal orientation within the thigh, in contrast to the vertically oriented tibia of the leg (<a
            href="#fig-ch08_04_02"
            class="autogenerated-content"
          >[link]</a
        >). The Q-angle is a measure of how far the femur is angled laterally away from vertical. The Q-angle is normally 10&#x2013;15 degrees, with females typically having a larger Q-angle due to their wider pelvis. During extension of the knee, the quadriceps femoris muscle pulls the patella both superiorly and laterally, with the lateral pull greater in women due to their large Q-angle. This makes women more vulnerable to developing patellofemoral syndrome than men. Normally, the large lip on the lateral side of the patellar surface of the femur compensates for the lateral pull on the patella, and thus helps to maintain its proper tracking.</p
      > <p
          class="para"
          id="fs-id2009732"
        >However, if the pull produced by the medial and lateral sides of the quadriceps femoris muscle is not properly balanced, abnormal tracking of the patella toward the lateral side may occur. With continued use, this produces pain and could result in damage to the articulating surfaces of the patella and femur, and the possible future development of arthritis. Treatment generally involves stopping the activity that produces knee pain for a period of time, followed by a gradual resumption of activity. Proper strengthening of the quadriceps femoris muscle to correct for imbalances is also important to help prevent reoccurrence.</p

      >When the foot comes into contact with the ground during walking, running, or jumping activities, the impact of the body weight puts a tremendous amount of pressure and force on the foot. During running, the force applied to each foot as it contacts the ground can be up to 2.5 times your body weight. The bones, joints, ligaments, and muscles of the foot absorb this force, thus greatly reducing the amount of shock that is passed superiorly into the lower limb and body. The arches of the foot play an important role in this shock-absorbing ability. When weight is applied to the foot, these arches will flatten somewhat, thus absorbing energy. When the weight is removed, the arch rebounds, giving &#x201C;spring&#x201D; to the step. The arches also serve to distribute body weight side to side and to either end of the foot.</p
    > <p
        class="para"
        id="fs-id1409532"
      >The foot has a transverse arch, a medial longitudinal arch, and a lateral longitudinal arch (see <a

          class="autogenerated-content"
        >[link]</a
      >). The transverse arch forms the medial-lateral curvature of the mid-foot. It is formed by the wedge shapes of the cuneiform bones and bases (proximal ends) of the first to fourth metatarsal bones. This arch helps to distribute body weight from side to side within the foot, thus allowing the foot to accommodate uneven terrain.</p
    > <p
        class="para"
        id="fs-id1352687"
      >The longitudinal arches run down the length of the foot. The lateral longitudinal arch is relatively flat, whereas the medial longitudinal arch is larger (taller). The longitudinal arches are formed by the tarsal bones posteriorly and the metatarsal bones anteriorly. These arches are supported at either end, where they contact the ground. Posteriorly, this support is provided by the calcaneus bone and anteriorly by the heads (distal ends) of the metatarsal bones. The talus bone, which receives the weight of the body, is located at the top of the longitudinal arches. Body weight is then conveyed from the talus to the ground by the anterior and posterior ends of these arches. Strong ligaments unite the adjacent foot bones to prevent disruption of the arches during weight bearing. On the bottom of the foot, additional ligaments tie together the anterior and posterior ends of the arches. These ligaments have elasticity, which allows them to stretch somewhat during weight bearing, thus allowing the longitudinal arches to spread. The stretching of these ligaments stores energy within the foot, rather than passing these forces into the leg. Contraction of the foot muscles also plays an important role in this energy absorption. When the weight is removed, the elastic ligaments recoil and pull the ends of the arches closer together. This recovery of the arches releases the stored energy and improves the energy efficiency of walking.</p

      >Stretching of the ligaments that support the longitudinal arches can lead to pain. This can occur in overweight individuals, with people who have jobs that involve standing for long periods of time (such as a waitress), or walking or running long distances. If stretching of the ligaments is prolonged, excessive, or repeated, it can result in a gradual lengthening of the supporting ligaments, with subsequent depression or collapse of the longitudinal arches, particularly on the medial side of the foot. This condition is called pes planus (&#x201C;flat foot&#x201D; or &#x201C;fallen arches&#x201D;).</p

          >The lower limb is divided into three regions. The thigh is the region located between the hip and knee joints. It contains the femur and the patella. The hip joint is formed by the articulation between the acetabulum of the hip bone and the head of the femur. The leg is the region between the knee and ankle joints, and contains the tibia (medially) and the fibula (laterally). The knee joint is formed by the articulations between the medial and lateral condyles of the femur, and the medial and lateral condyles of the tibia. Also associated with the knee is the patella, which articulates with the patellar surface of the distal femur. The foot is found distal to the ankle and contains 26 bones. The ankle joint is formed by the articulations between the talus bone of the foot and the distal end of the tibia, the medial malleolus of the tibia, and the lateral malleolus of the fibula. The posterior foot contains the seven tarsal bones, which are the talus, calcaneus, navicular, cuboid, and the medial, intermediate, and lateral cuneiform bones. The anterior foot consists of the five metatarsal bones, which are numbered 1&#x2013;5 starting on the medial side of the foot. The toes contain 14 phalanx bones, with the big toe (toe number 1) having a proximal and a distal phalanx, and the other toes having proximal, middle, and distal phalanges.</p

          >The talus bone of the foot receives the weight of the body from the tibia. The talus bone then distributes this weight toward the ground in two directions: one-half of the body weight is passed in a posterior direction and one-half of the weight is passed in an anterior direction. Describe the arrangement of the tarsal and metatarsal bones that are involved in both the posterior and anterior distribution of body weight.</p

          >The talus bone articulates superiorly with the tibia and fibula at the ankle joint, with body weight passed from the tibia to the talus. Body weight from the talus is transmitted to the ground by both ends of the medial and lateral longitudinal foot arches. Weight is passed posteriorly through both arches to the calcaneus bone, which forms the heel of the foot and is in contact with the ground. On the medial side of the foot, body weight is passed anteriorly from the talus bone to the navicular bone, and then to the medial, intermediate, and lateral cuneiform bones. The cuneiform bones pass the weight anteriorly to the first, second, and third metatarsal bones, whose heads (distal ends) are in contact with the ground. On the lateral side, body weight is passed anteriorly from the talus through the calcaneus, cuboid, and fourth and fifth metatarsal bones. The talus bone thus transmits body weight posteriorly to the calcaneus and anteriorly through the navicular, cuneiform, and cuboid bones, and metatarsals one through five.</p
