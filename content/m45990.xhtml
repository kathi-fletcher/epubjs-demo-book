    >Anatomists and health care providers use terminology that can be bewildering to the uninitiated. However, the purpose of this language is not to confuse, but rather to increase precision and reduce medical errors. For example, is a scar &#x201C;above the wrist&#x201D; located on the forearm two or three inches away from the hand? Or is it at the base of the hand? Is it on the palm-side or back-side? By using precise anatomical terminology, we eliminate ambiguity. Anatomical terms derive from ancient Greek and Latin words. Because these languages are no longer used in everyday conversation, the meaning of their words does not change.</p

    >Anatomical terms are made up of roots, prefixes, and suffixes. The root of a term often refers to an organ, tissue, or condition, whereas the prefix or suffix often describes the root. For example, in the disorder hypertension, the prefix &#x201C;hyper-&#x201D; means &#x201C;high&#x201D; or &#x201C;over,&#x201D; and the root word &#x201C;tension&#x201D; refers to pressure, so the word &#x201C;hypertension&#x201D; refers to abnormally high blood pressure.</p

      >To further increase precision, anatomists standardize the way in which they view the body. Just as maps are normally oriented with north at the top, the standard body &#x201C;map,&#x201D; or <span
          class="term"
        >anatomical position</span
      >, is that of the body standing upright, with the feet at shoulder width and parallel, toes forward. The upper limbs are held out to each side, and the palms of the hands face forward as illustrated in <a

      >. Using this standard position reduces confusion. It does not matter how the body being described is oriented, the terms are used as if it is in anatomical position. For example, a scar in the &#x201C;anterior (front) carpal (wrist) region&#x201D; would be present on the palm side of the wrist. The term &#x201C;anterior&#x201D; would be used even if the hand were palm down on a table.</p

Together the cranial cavity and vertebral cavity can be referred to as the dorsal body cavity. The thoracic cavity consists of three cavities that fill the interior area of the chest. The two pleural cavities are situated on both sides of the body, anterior to the spine and lateral to the breastbone. The superior mediastinum is a wedge-shaped cavity located between the superior regions of the two thoracic cavities. The pericardial cavity within the mediastinum is located at the center of the chest below the superior mediastinum. The pericardial cavity roughly outlines the shape of the heart. The diaphragm divides the thoracic and the abdominal cavities. The abdominal cavity occupies the entire lower half of the trunk, anterior to the spine. Just under the abdominal cavity, anterior to the buttocks, is the pelvic cavity. The pelvic cavity is funnel shaped and is located inferior and anterior to the abdominal cavity.

The serous fluid produced by the serous membranes reduces friction between the walls of the cavities and the internal organs when they move, such as when the lungs inflate or the heart beats. Both the parietal and visceral serosa secrete the thin, slippery serous fluid that prevents friction when an organ slides past the walls of a cavity. In the pleural cavities, pleural fluid prevents friction between the lungs and the walls of the cavity. In the pericardial sac, pericardial fluid prevents friction between the heart and the walls of the pericardial sac. And in the peritoneal cavity, peritoneal fluid prevents friction between abdominal and pelvic organs and the wall of the cavity. The serous membranes therefore provide additional protection to the viscera they enclose by reducing friction that could lead to inflammation of the organs.</p

      >Ancient Greek and Latin words are used to build anatomical terms. A standard reference position for mapping the body&#x2019;s structures is the normal anatomical position. Regions of the body are identified using terms such as &#x201C;occipital&#x201D; that are more precise than common words and phrases such as &#x201C;the back of the head.&#x201D; Directional terms such as anterior and posterior are essential for accurately describing the relative locations of body structures. Images of the body&#x2019;s interior commonly align along one of three planes: the sagittal, frontal, or transverse. The body&#x2019;s organs are organized in one of two main cavities&#x2014;dorsal (also referred to posterior) and ventral (also referred to anterior)&#x2014;which are further sub-divided according to the structures present in each area. The serous membranes have two layers&#x2014;parietal and visceral&#x2014;surrounding a fluid filled space. Serous membranes cover the lungs (pleural serosa), heart (pericardial serosa), and some abdominopelvic organs (peritoneal serosa).</p
