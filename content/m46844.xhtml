  <body><div class="title">Preface</div><div class="abstract" data-unknown="true">Human Anatomy and Physiology is designed for the two-semester anatomy and physiology course taken by life science and allied health students. The textbook follows the scope and sequence of most Human Anatomy and Physiology courses, and its coverage and organization were informed by hundreds of instructors who teach the course. Instructors can customize the book, adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom. The artwork for this textbook is aimed focusing student learning through a powerful blend of traditional depictions and instructional innovations. Color is used sparingly, to emphasize the most important aspects of any given illustration. Significant use of micrographs from the University of Michigan complement the illustrations, and provide the students with a meaningful alternate depiction of each concept. Finally, enrichment elements provide relevance and deeper context for students, particularly in the areas of health, disease, and information relevant to their intended careers.<div class="body" id="22fddb75-8ae0-4cb7-bf3d-67bfc0c9877f"></div></div> <p class="para" id="delete_me">Welcome to <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Human Anatomy and Physiology</em>, an OpenStax College resource. We created this textbook with several goals in mind: accessibility, customization, and student engagement—helping students reach high levels of academic scholarship. Instructors and students alike will find that this textbook offers a thorough introduction to the content in an accessible format. </p><section id="eip-7"><h1 class="title">About OpenStax College</h1><p class="para" id="eip-463"> OpenStax College is a nonprofit organization committed to improving student access to quality learning materials. Our free textbooks are developed and peer-reviewed by educators to ensure that they are readable, accurate, and organized in accordance with the scope and sequence requirements of today’s college courses. Unlike traditional textbooks, OpenStax College resources live online and are owned by the community of educators using them. Through partnerships with companies and foundations committed to reducing costs for students, we are working to improve access to higher education for all. OpenStax College is an initiative of Rice University and is made possible through the generous support of several philanthropic foundations. </p></section><section id="eip-374"><h1 class="title">About OpenStax College’s Resources</h1><p class="para" id="eip-0"> OpenStax College resources provide quality academic instruction. Three key features set our materials apart from others: 1) They can be easily customized by instructors for each class, 2) they are “living” resources that grow online through contributions from science educators, and 3) they are available for free or for a minimal cost. </p><section id="eip-262"><h2 class="title">Customization</h2><p class="para" id="eip-362"> OpenStax College learning resources are conceived and written with flexibility in mind so that they can be customized for each course. Our textbooks provide a solid foundation on which instructors can build their own texts. Instructors can select the sections that are most relevant to their curricula and create a textbook that speaks directly to the needs of their students. Instructors are encouraged to expand on existing examples in the text by adding unique context via geographically localized applications and topical connections. </p> <p class="para" id="eip-id1166206909033"><em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Human Anatomy and Physiology</em> can be easily customized using our online platform (https://openstaxcollege.org/textbooks/anatomy-and-physiology/adapt). The text is arranged in a modular chapter format. Simply select the content most relevant to your syllabus and create a textbook that addresses the needs of your class. This customization feature will ensure that your textbook reflects the goals of your course.</p></section><section id="eip-185"><h2 class="title">Curation</h2><p class="para" id="eip-155">To broaden access and encourage community curation, <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Human Anatomy and Physiology</em> is “open source” under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license.

It supports effective teaching and learning, and prepares students for further learning and future careers. The text focuses on the most important concepts and aims to minimize distracting students with more minor details. </p> <p class="para" id="eip-id1166207179754">The development choices for this textbook were made with the guidance of hundreds of faculty who are deeply involved in teaching this course. These choices led to innovations in art, terminology, career orientation, practical applications, and multimedia-based learning, all with a goal of increasing relevance to students. We strove to make the discipline meaningful and memorable to students, so that they can draw from it a working knowledge that will enrich their future studies. </p><section id="eip-29"><h2 class="title">Coverage and Scope</h2><p class="para" id="eip-369">The units of our <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Human Anatomy and Physiology</em> textbook adhere to the scope and sequence followed by most two-semester courses nationwide. </p><section id="eip-217"><h3 class="title">Unit 1: Levels of Organization </h3><p class="para" id="eip-719">Chapters 1–4 provide students with a basic understanding of human anatomy and physiology, including its language, the levels of organization, and the basics of chemistry and cell biology. These chapters provide a foundation for the further study of the body. They also focus particularly on how the body’s regions, important chemicals, and cells maintain homeostasis.<br> Chapter 1 An Introduction to the Human Body<br> Chapter 2 The Chemical Level of Organization<br> Chapter 3 The Cellular Level of Organization<br> Chapter 4 The Tissue Level of Organization<br> </p></section><section id="eip-146"><h3 class="title">Unit 2: Support and Movement </h3><p class="para" id="eip-760">In Chapters 5–11, students explore the skin, the largest organ of the body, and examine the body’s skeletal and muscular systems, following a traditional sequence of topics.

The strongest line is used to highlight the most important structures, and shading is used to show dimension and shape. Color is used sparingly to highlight and clarify the primary anatomical or functional point of the illustration. This technique is intended to draw students’ attention to the critical learning point in the illustration, without distraction from excessive gradients, shadows, and highlights. Full color is used when the structure or process requires it (for example, muscle diagrams and cardiovascular system illustrations). </p><figure id="eip-id1169396666468" class="" title=""><figcaption><div class="title">The Pharynx</div>By highlighting the most important portions of the illustration, the artwork helps students focus on the most important points, without overwhelming them. </figcaption><span class="media" id="preface" data-alt="A color illustration of the pharynx."> <img data-mime-type="image/png" alt="A color illustration of the pharynx." width="300" draggable="false" src="../resources/Preface.png"/> </span></figure><p></p><section id="eip-817"><h3 class="title">Micrographs</h3><p class="para" id="eip-564"> Micrograph magnifications have been calculated based on the objective provided with the image.
